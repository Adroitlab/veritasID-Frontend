## Project Overview

VeritasID is a contribution-gated reputation and credentialing protocol built on the Stellar network. The frontend is a modern React application that serves as the primary interface through which developers connect their GitHub identity to their Stellar wallet, view their on-chain credential portfolio, and share a public verifiable profile with employers, DAOs, and grant committees.

Each credential in a developer's VeritasID profile represents a real, verified open-source contribution — a merged pull request, a resolved bug, a security audit, or a documentation contribution — encoded as a non-transferable on-chain attestation following the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard. No resumes. No endorsements. Only proof.

---

## Aim

To provide developers with a seamless, trustworthy interface for building and showcasing a sovereign, on-chain professional identity rooted entirely in the verifiable reality of their open-source contributions — positioning VeritasID as the industry-standard credentialing layer for OSS developers across the Stellar ecosystem and beyond.

---

## Objectives

- Deliver a frictionless onboarding experience by linking GitHub OAuth accounts to Stellar wallet addresses in a single flow
- Display a developer's full credential portfolio with filtering by contribution type, repository, impact score, and issuance date
- Render publicly shareable contributor profile pages that require no authentication to view, enabling use as a professional reference
- Provide a credential verification interface where any third party can independently verify the authenticity of a credential against the on-chain registry
- Visualise reputation scores derived from the cumulative weight of on-chain credentials, with transparent scoring breakdowns
- Support W3C Verifiable Credential export so developers can present credentials in external systems
- Enable organisations and DAOs to configure contribution-gated access rules and verify applicants against the VeritasID registry
- Ensure full wallet-native interaction via Freighter and the Stellar Wallets Kit, with no custody of private keys at any point
- Maintain a fully accessible, responsive UI consistent across desktop and mobile viewports
